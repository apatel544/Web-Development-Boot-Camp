# Web Development Boot Camp

This project is to track the progress I make in an online boot camp for web development.
For reference to which boot camp I am taking, see the link below to find the Udemy Boot Camp I am using for this repository.

Wanna check out my progress live? Head over to my site: https://apatel544.github.io/cv/

The site will update as I progress through the bootcamp so just to let you know where I am at I will keep a timeline to share what you are expected to see.
